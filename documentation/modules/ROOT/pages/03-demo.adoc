= See the Solution in Action

== Setup the Solution

To provision the demo you will perform the following steps - each of which are explained in detail in the next sections:

* Gain access to Red Hat OpenShift. This solution pattern has been tested on https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/welcome/index.html[OpenShift 4.13^]
* Ensure you have the toold `oc` and `ansible` installed in your local environment such as your laptop
* Access the OpenShift cluster with cluster-admin privileges
* Log in to OpenShift with `cluster-admin` role via cli
* Run the Ansible playbook 
* Run a  bunch of scripts to deploy the Solution Pattern in your OpenShift cluster


=== Before getting started
Here is the list of tools you need in your machine to so you can use the automated installation.

* https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift CLI (oc client)^]
* https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html[Ansible CLI ^]
** https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/kubernetes/core/k8s_module.html[Ansible kubernetes.core module^]

To check if you have the cli tools, you can open your terminal and use following commands:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
oc version #openshift cli client
ansible --version
ansible-galaxy --version
ansible-galaxy collection list #the list should include kubernetes.core
----

If you can't see `kubernetes.core` collection listed, you can install it with `ansible-galaxy`:

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install kubernetes.core
----


=== Installing the demo

* Login to your OpenShift cluser as cluster-admin (because a number of operators will need to be installed)
* Click on the username on the top right hand, and then click on *Copy login command*. This will open another tab and you will need to login again
* Click on *Display token* link, and copy the command under  *Log in with this token*. This will look like this 
[source,shell script]
----
oc login --token=<token> --server=<server>
----

* Clone the ansible scripts as follows in an appropriate folder in your local environment

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
git clone https://github.com/rh-soln-pattern-sentiment-analysis/ansible
----
* Navigate to the `ansible` folder

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
cd ansible
----

* Run the ansible playbook as show below. This will take a few minutes to complete. Ensure the script is deployed without errors

[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
ansible-playbook playbooks/install.yml -e"ACTION=provision"
----

* This ansible playbook is still work-in-progress, so you need to run some scripts to complete installation. Once the ansible playbook is all setup, this step will be simplified.
** You will need to clone another git repo. So navigate away from the `ansible` folder
**  Clone the script repo
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----
git clone  https://github.com/rh-soln-pattern-sentiment-analysis/deployment
----

** navigate to right folder, and run the script
+
[.console-input]
[source,shell script]
----

cd deployment
./complete-install.sh
----
** This script will display the Grafana Dashboard URL at the end of execution along with the username/password. Make note of this
+
[source,shell script]
----
This is the grafana route

That's it! You are set to try out this Solution Pattern! ｡◕‿◕｡


== Walkthrough guide

=== Explore the deployment on Red Hat OpenShift
There are 4 namespaces which are used for this Solution Pattern

* *sentiment-analysis*: 
** most of the microservices
** knative services, knative brokers, and  knative triggers
* *influxdb-project*: 
** InfluxDB - a time series database 
** Python based connector which reads from Kafka and pushes the content into InfluxDB  
** Grafana dashboard
* *globex*: A number of fundamental microservices and database of the fictitious retail customer Globex, which are used in the our application, but aren't really impacting the Sentiment Analysis solution pattern
* *globex-mw*: 
** Red Hat AMQ Streams (Apache Kafka) 
** Kafdrop (a Kafka topic visualization tool)
* *rhsso*:
** Red Hat SSO based on Keycloak which manages the user login. You can find the password for the `admin` user within the Secret *credential-rhsso* within the *rhsso* namespace

=== Login to the Globex Webapplication

* Navigate the *sentiment-analysis* namespace and look for the *globex-web-reviews* deployment in the Developers perspective. 
+
image:sentiment-analysis.png[] 
* Launch the globex-web-reviews app by clicking on the "launch arrow". 
** Alternatively the route can be fetched by running this command from your command line +
*oc get route/globex-web-reviews -n sentiment-analysis*
+
image:launch-globex.png[width=30%]
* A number of users have been already setup for you
** Choose any of these as login user names: *asilva*, *mmiller*, *asanders*, *cjones* or *pwong*
** All users have  the same password:  *openshift*
* Once you login, you can navigate to the *Cool Stufff Store* from the top menubar and click on any of the products to view the product details.
+

=== Review Moderation scenario
* Type in a review comment -  which is socially acceptable and not abusive - and submit the review. 
+
image:enter-review.png[]
* You will see a notification on the screen that the review has been submitted
+
image:view-review.png[]
* Wait for a fewseconds and the review would appear on the page - if your review was moderated as acceptable.
* If you are adventurous, try one with abusive langage - not that we encourage this behaviour :) - but let's put the system through its paces
** You would notice that this review (ideally) will not appear on the screen. 

Let us now trace the flow of the reviews across the various systems

* The review gets submitted to the *globex.reviews* kafka topic, which then gets picked up by the Intelligent App *aiml-moderate-reviews*
** This service routes the reviews to either *reviews.moderated* topic or *reviews.denied* topic depending on whether review's languge was acceptable or not
+
image:aiml-moderate-reviews-app.png[]
* You can view these topics through Kafkdrop. To access Kafdrop, navigate to *globex-mw* namespace, and launch kafdrop.
* Filter the topics with the word *review* to see a list of relevant topics
+
image:reviews-topics.png[]
* Click on each of the topics to see the actual messages.
* This is the *reviews.moderated* topic. You will notic that the message is a JSON.
** What is even more interestig is the headers of this message *ce-type* and *ce-source*
** These headers are present because the messages are all managed as https://cloudevents.io/[Cloud Events^]. CloudEvents is a a specification for describing event data in a common way. 
+
image:moderated-review.png[]

=== Sentiment Analysis scenario
* Remember the grafana link that you made a note of? Now is a good time to navigate to that URL. Login using *admin/graphsRcool*
** In case you can't find it, don't fret :) We got a plan B for you
** From the *Administrator view*, go to *influxdb-project* namespace. 
** Navigate to *Networking > Services > grafana*. 
** Navigate to the *Location* displayed under *Service Routing > Service address*
+
image:grafana-url.png[]
* Click on left-hand menu, and click on *Dashboards* Now click on the *General* folder displayed
** This will show a link to *GLOBEX Sentiment Analysis Dashboard*. Click on this to launch the Dashboard
+
image:grafana-landing.png[]
* Navigate to the Globex Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

You will see a couple of data there from the reviews you had submitted in the previous step - nothing much to talk about! Yet..... +

Let's use a simulator to submit a number of reviews to see some serious stuff!!  \m/

* Navigate back to the `sentiment-analysis` namespace and look for the `reviews-simulator` deployment and launch it. 
+
image:reviews-simulator.png[width=30%]
* This is deployed as a knative services with zero replica. So you can see a pod getting created as soon as you launch it.
* Click on the *POST*, and then the *Try it out* button.
* Choose the *Clothing Catalogue* option, and click *Execute*. A number of random reviews are generated for you.
+
image:simulate-clothing-reviews.png[]
* Go ahead and try out the *Bags* option as well!
* Give it a go a few more times maybe


Alright.. Let's go check out the Grafana Dashboard.. 

* You can view a doughnut shaped chart right on top of the page showing the breakup of the overall sentiment across Globex. 
* Right below this, you will also see the charts showing the sentiment analysis breakup for Clothing and Bags. 
+
image::clothing-dashboard.png[] 
* You can duplicate these charts with other Catalgues as well. Here is a list of all of the possible catalogues 
** clothing
** bags
** utensils
** office supplies
** fashion accessory
** electronics
** sports equipment

* You can generate more reviews for the *Bags Catalogue* using the simulator to view more data on the dashboard.
+
image:bag-dashboard.png[]
* You can also view the Tabular Data of the Bags and Clothing catalogues
